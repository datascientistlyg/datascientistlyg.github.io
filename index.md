## What Will Affect Your Housing Price

I am really interested in real estate market and always interested what causing the housing price.

I did analysis using the dataset(AmesHouring.csv) I found from Kaggle. And I found the answers to the following questions:

1. What are the factors which affects the housing price mostly?
2. Is the result intuitively accurate?
