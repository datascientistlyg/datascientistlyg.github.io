## What Factors Will Affect Your Housing Price

I am really interested in real estate market and always interested what causing the housing price.

I did analysis using the dataset(AmesHouring.csv) I found from Kaggle. And I found the answers to the following questions:

1. How the factors correlated with each other?
2. What are the factors which affects the housing price mostly?
3. Is the result be intuitively verified?

### What are the factors between each factors?

The heatmap above show the relations between each factors. 

### What are the factors which affects the housing price mostly?

The boxplot provides a clearer information about the degree of the factors affect the housing price. It is clear that overall quanlity, living area, garage cars, garage area, total Bsmt SF, 1st Flr SF, year built, full bath are the factors affect housing price mostly.

### Can the result be intuitively verified?

From the picture above, we can see that overall the housing price fits the model although some of the extreme values do not fit. 

### Conclusion
Features such as overall quanlity, living area, garage cars, garage area, total Bsmt SF, 1st Flr SF, year built, full bath are the factors affect housing price mostly. And the result can intuitively reflect our analysis. For better analysis, we can use multi layer neural networks for analysis.
